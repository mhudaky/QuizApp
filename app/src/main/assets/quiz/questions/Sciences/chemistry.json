      "question": "What is the main gas found in the air we breathe?",
      "answers": ["Nitrogen", "Oxygen", "Carbon Dioxide", "Hydrogen"],
      "correct": "Nitrogen",
      "reasoning": "The air we breathe is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen, making it the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen makes up about 21%, and carbon dioxide and hydrogen are present in much smaller amounts."

      "question": "What is the pH level of pure water?",
      "answers": ["7", "0", "14", "3"],
      "correct": "7",
      "reasoning": "Pure water has a neutral pH level of 7. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline."

      "question": "Which element is known for its use in pencils?",
      "answers": ["Graphite", "Charcoal", "Lead", "Ink"],
      "correct": "Graphite",
      "reasoning": "Pencils contain graphite, a form of carbon, which is used to produce the writing material. Charcoal and lead are not used in modern pencils, and ink is used in pens."

      "question": "Which gas is produced when acids react with metals?",
      "answers": ["Hydrogen", "Oxygen", "Nitrogen", "Carbon Dioxide"],
      "correct": "Hydrogen",
      "reasoning": "When acids react with metals, they typically produce hydrogen gas. This reaction is common in acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacting with metals such as zinc or magnesium."

    {
      "question": "What type of bond is formed when two atoms share electrons?",
      "answers": ["Covalent bond", "Ionic bond", "Metallic bond", "Hydrogen bond"],
      "correct": "Covalent bond",
      "reasoning": "A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share electrons. Ionic bonds involve the transfer of electrons, metallic bonds occur between metal atoms, and hydrogen bonds are weak interactions involving hydrogen atoms."

      "question": "What is the molecular formula for glucose?",
      "answers": ["C6H12O6", "C12H22O11", "CH4", "C2H6O"],
      "correct": "C6H12O6",
      "reasoning": "Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6. It is a simple sugar and an important energy source in living organisms. C12H22O11 is the formula for sucrose (table sugar), CH4 is methane, and C2H6O is ethanol."

      "question": "What is the main component of natural gas?",
      "answers": ["Methane", "Propane", "Butane", "Ethane"],
      "correct": "Methane",
      "reasoning": "The main component of natural gas is methane (CH4), which is a simple hydrocarbon. Propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), and ethane (C2H6) are also hydrocarbons found in natural gas but in smaller quantities."

    {
      "question": "Which law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature, given constant pressure?",
      "answers": ["Charles's Law", "Boyle's Law", "Avogadro's Law", "Dalton's Law"],
      "correct": "Charles's Law",
      "reasoning": "Charles's Law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when pressure is held constant. Boyle's Law describes the relationship between pressure and volume, Avogadro's Law involves the relationship between volume and the number of moles, and Dalton's Law pertains to the partial pressures of gases in a mixture."

      "question": "What is the term for a reaction that absorbs heat from its surroundings?",
      "answers": ["Endothermic", "Exothermic", "Isothermal", "Adiabatic"],
      "correct": "Endothermic",
      "reasoning": "An endothermic reaction absorbs heat from its surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature. Exothermic reactions release heat, isothermal processes occur at a constant temperature, and adiabatic processes involve no heat exchange."

      "question": "What is the hybridization of the carbon atoms in ethylene (C2H4)?",
      "answers": ["sp2", "sp3", "sp", "dsp2"],
      "correct": "sp2",
      "reasoning": "In ethylene (C2H4), the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized, resulting in a planar structure with a double bond between the carbon atoms. The sp3 hybridization occurs in tetrahedral structures, sp in linear structures, and dsp2 in certain square planar structures."

      "question": "What type of isomerism is exhibited by compounds with the same molecular formula but different connectivity of their atoms?",
      "answers": ["Structural isomerism", "Geometric isomerism", "Optical isomerism", "Conformational isomerism"],
      "correct": "Structural isomerism",
      "reasoning": "Structural isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of their atoms. Geometric isomerism involves different spatial arrangements around a double bond, optical isomerism involves non-superimposable mirror images, and conformational isomerism involves different rotational forms of the same molecule."
