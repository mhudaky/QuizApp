      "question": "What is the primary function of insulin?",
      "answers": ["Regulate blood sugar levels", "Aid digestion", "Support immune function", "Promote bone growth"],
      "correct": "Regulate blood sugar levels",
      "reasoning": "Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. Digestive enzymes aid digestion, the immune system fights infections, and growth hormones promote bone growth."
