      "answers": ["20", "25", "30", "35"],
      "correct": "25",
      "reasoning": "The area of a square is calculated as the side length squared. A square with a side length of 5 has an area of 5 x 5 = 25. The other options do not correctly calculate the area of a square with a side length of 5."

      "question": "What is the perimeter of a rectangle with length 10 and width 5?",
      "answers": ["30", "40", "50", "60"],
      "correct": "30",
      "reasoning": "The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 x (length + width). For a rectangle with length 10 and width 5, the perimeter is 2 x (10 + 5) = 30. The other options do not correctly calculate the perimeter of this rectangle."

      "question": "What is the volume of a cube with edge length 3?",
      "answers": ["9", "18", "27", "36"],
      "correct": "27",
      "reasoning": "The volume of a cube is calculated as the edge length cubed. A cube with an edge length of 3 has a volume of 3 x 3 x 3 = 27. The other options do not correctly calculate the volume of a cube with an edge length of 3."

    {
      "question": "Solve for x: 3x + 9 = 21",
      "answers": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
      "correct": "4",
      "reasoning": "To solve for x in the equation 3x + 9 = 21, first subtract 9 from both sides to get 3x = 12, then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 4. The other options do not satisfy the original equation."

    {
      "question": "If the angle of a circle sector is 90 degrees, what fraction of the circle's area is it?",
      "answers": ["1/4", "1/3", "1/2", "1/5"],
      "correct": "1/4",
      "reasoning": "A circle has 360 degrees. A sector with an angle of 90 degrees is 1/4 of the circle because 90/360 = 1/4. The other options do not correctly represent the fraction of the circle's area corresponding to a 90-degree sector."

      "question": "What is the derivative of x^2?",
      "answers": ["x", "2x", "3x^2", "2x^2"],
      "correct": "2x",
      "reasoning": "The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x, according to the power rule in calculus. The other options do not correctly represent the derivative of x^2."

      "question": "What is the integral of 2x dx?",
      "answers": ["x^2 + C", "2x^2 + C", "x^2/2 + C", "2x + C"],
      "correct": "x^2 + C",
      "reasoning": "The integral of 2x dx is x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration. This follows from the reverse of the differentiation rule for powers of x. The other options do not correctly represent the integral of 2x dx."

      "question": "Solve for y: y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0",
      "answers": ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
      "correct": "2",
      "reasoning": "The equation y^2 - 4y + 4 = 0 can be factored into (y - 2)^2 = 0, which implies that y = 2. The other options do not satisfy the original equation."
