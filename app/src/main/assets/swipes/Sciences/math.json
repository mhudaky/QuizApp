      "question": "The sum of the angles in a triangle always equals 180 degrees.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees, due to the properties of parallel lines intersected by a transversal."

    {
      "question": "The square root of 64 is 8.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "The square root of 64 is indeed 8, as 8 times 8 equals 64."
    },
    {
      "question": "2 + 2 equals 5.",
      "answer": false,
      "reasoning": "2 + 2 equals 4, not 5. This is a basic arithmetic fact."

      "question": "A right angle is 90 degrees.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "A right angle is defined as an angle of exactly 90 degrees."

      "question": "The formula for the area of a circle is pi times radius squared.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "The formula for the area of a circle is indeed pi (π) multiplied by the square of the radius, often written as A = πr^2."

      "question": "The derivative of x^2 is 2x.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is 2x, according to the power rule in calculus."

    {
      "question": "The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes in an experiment is 2.",
      "answer": false,
      "reasoning": "The sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes of an experiment must equal 1, not 2, according to the basic principle of probability."

      "question": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "The Pythagorean theorem correctly describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle: c^2 = a^2 + b^2."

    {
      "question": "If the odds of an event happening are 1/3, then the probability of it not happening is 2/3.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "If the probability of an event happening is 1/3, then the probability of it not happening is indeed 1 - 1/3, which simplifies to 2/3."

      "question": "The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the y-intercept and b is the slope.",
      "answer": false,
      "reasoning": "In the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, y = mx + b, m represents the slope of the line, and b represents the y-intercept."

      "question": "Fermat's Last Theorem was proved by Andrew Wiles in 1994.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for n greater than 2, was indeed proved by Andrew Wiles in 1994."

      "question": "Euler's identity is considered a profound mathematical equation: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0.",
      "answer": true,
      "reasoning": "Euler's identity e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 is celebrated for its beauty, as it links five fundamental mathematical constants."

      "question": "The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances and have been completely solved.",
      "answer": false,
      "reasoning": "The Navier-Stokes equations, fundamental in fluid dynamics, have not been completely solved, particularly for three-dimensional incompressible flows."
